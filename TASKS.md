# Tasks

Live task list mirroring Claude Code's task manager. The canonical state is in
the harness (`/tasks` slash command); this file is the durable copy that
travels with the repo. Update it alongside task transitions in the same
commit.

## Mid-flight discoveries (logged in `PLAN.md` Decisions)

- **2026-06-02** — Polar SPEED stream is km/h, FIT enhancedSpeed is m/s (off by 3.6×). Caught by Strava "may be in a vehicle" flag during T6.5. Fix: `36542eb`.
- **2026-06-02** — One real session had a 4.5 km GPS teleport in 1 second. Strava flagged "GPS had a bad day". Converter is faithful; source data is glitched. Spawned T6.6 (detection + optional crop).
- **2026-06-02** — Wave-2 worktree-isolation merge: T8-A, T9-A, T10-A all installed/wrote shadcn primitives in their own worktrees. T9-A had the most complete (real shadcn-svelte CLI output); T8-A & T10-A's stubs were discarded in favor of T9-A's during the integration commit (`d837804`). Lesson: pin shadcn install to a single agent in future fan-outs.
- **2026-06-02** — Svelte 5 `$effect` reactive-loop bug in App.svelte's `perFileUrls` URL revoker. Reading `perFileUrls` inside its own effect re-triggered it. Fix: `untrack()` the read. (`5fe8122`)

## Artifacts in this repo

- `PLAN.md` — full implementation plan (decomposition, decisions log, orchestration playbook)
- `RESEARCH.md` — research notes on FIT format, Polar→FIT sport mapping, `@garmin/fitsdk` audit
- `TASKS.md` — this file
- `WORK_LOG.md` — per-task agent telemetry (tokens, tool uses, durations) + session cost
- `scripts/anonymize-fixture.mjs` — reusable PII-stripper for Polar exports
- `fixtures/*.json` — three anonymized training-session fixtures (one large GPS, one tiny indoor, one mid-size GPS with a known teleport)
- `src/core/*` — pure conversion logic (browser- and Node-portable)
- `src/validate/*` — round-trip + conservation + GPS-quality checks
- `src/webapp/*` — Svelte 5 wizard UI + Web Worker pipeline
- `src/cli/*` — Node CLI: `pnpm convert` / `pnpm inspect` / `pnpm validate`
- `out/` — gitignored; contains the user's converted .fit files when `pnpm convert` runs
